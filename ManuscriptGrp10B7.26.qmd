# Summary/Abstract

Group Ten is analyzing the historical data collected by various public agencies to determine if the impact of Varroa, American Foulbrood, and global warming has demonstrated an increase in hive losses across the United States and Texas. The research will be accomplished using data sets derived from the following agencies: National Agricultural Statistics Service, Agricultural Statistics Board, and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Data sets contain several years of hive losses from varroa and bacterium, including recent possible environmental thermal global warming. A visualization of outcomes using R demonstrates and validates possible detrimental effects on honeybee colonies in the United States and Texas wrought by the negative impact of mites, bacterium, and global warming that will affect honey production and inevitably impact food production.

Honeybees have been nature's pollinators for centuries, with documented relationships with humans dating back to ancient Egyptians and Hindus. Historically, humans have maintained beehives, using honey as medicine in various cultures such as the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chinese, Greek, and Roman cultures. The natural antibacterial properties of honey made it a valuable treatment for wounds and preventing infection; this practice was used by both Romans in ancient times and Russians during World War I. Honeybees and other pollinators are critical for food production and nutritional security, yet bees face a variety of survival challenges. Currently, Varroa mites significantly impact bee colonies. This mite, a tiny red-brown parasite, infests hives and live on adult honeybees and reproduce on larvae and pupae in the developing brood. Another major threat is American Foulbrood Disease (AFB), caused by the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. AFB is a disease that is fatal to honeybee larvae and is found worldwide. The only effective control measure of AFB is to incinerate and destroy infected hives and live bees, mitigating the infectious spread to other colonies. In addition, the exploration of climate change impacting honeybee colony losses has only recently been researched. While there are correlations between higher winter temperatures and greater colony losses, the effects of warmer autumn and winter temperatures on colony population dynamics and age structure as potential causes of reduced colony survival have not yet been fully investigated.Index Catalog // USDA Economics, Statistics and Market Information System.

## Description of data and data source

Bee colonies maintained by beekeepers are considered livestock by the USDA due to their ability to produce honey, a consumable food item, and their essential role in assisting farmers with pollination during crop seasons. Given the importance of bee colonies in agriculture, it was logical to source data from the following two authoritative websites: 1. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): This site provides comprehensive agricultural data, including statistics on honey production and colony health. 2. Bee Informed Partnership: This site offers detailed insights and research on bee colony management and health, contributing valuable information on the status and trends of bee populations.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

Hypothesis: "The negative impacts of mites, bacterium, and global warming have detrimental effects on honeybee colonies in the United States and Texas, which in turn will lead to a decline in honey production and negatively impact food production." This hypothesis can be tested and validated through a visualization of outcomes using R, demonstrating the relationship between these factors and their effects on honeybee colonies.

# Methods

*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*

## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with Biorender. We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually genera#ted and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one #from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
#knitr::include_graphics(here("assets","antigen-recognition.png"))
```

## Data aquisition

We got our data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

## Data import and cleaning

Our data was sourced from a few different datasets. We had to remove blank spaces and columns that were not pertinent to our analysis. We then filtered out other observations that did not directly deal with the variables we are exploring: cause of death to bee colonies and how they are affected by mites and climate change. We single out data that represented losses and location to explore the different states by year and determine how the colonies were affected.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}

data <- read.csv("DatabyState.csv")
```

```{r}
View(data)
```

```{r}
# Select all columns except 3, 6, and 9
Data_Clean <- dplyr::select(data, -c(3, 6, 9))
```

```{r}
# Output cleaned data file to a csv file.
write.csv(Data_Clean, "Databystate_Clean.csv")
```

```{r}
view(Data_Clean)
```

```{r}
# Filter for rows where "Loss" or "Deadout" is present in any column (case-insensitive)
library(stringr)  # Load stringr package for regular expressions
data_filtered <- Data_Clean[rowSums(sapply(data, grepl, pattern = c("Loss"), ignore.case = TRUE)) > 0, ]
```

```{r}
# Output cleaned data file to a csv file.
write.csv(Data_Clean, "Databystate_Filtered.csv")
```

*****REMOVE!!!!

STATE ANSI IS THE CODE FOR STATE BY PERIOD AND YEAR. VALUE IS COUNT. ORIGINAL BOXPLOTS WERE EXACTLY THE SAME******

The following data set is organized by year, state, period of the year, type of loss, and count. There are only three observed years, with observations from 2015 to 2017. Loss by collapse disorder describes a colony that losses a majority of its worker bees. Loss by deadout describes a loss of the entire colony: workers, drones, larvae, pupa, and queen. The bar chart shown below depicts loss count by type and period. The periods roughly follow North American seasons; April through June is spring, January through March is winter, July through September is summer, and October through December is fall. We can observe a pattern in the losses increasing in the first half of the year (January through June), while losses decrease the second half. This could suggest that as the weather warms, colonies are affected by the increasing heat.
```{r}
ggplot(data_filtered, aes(Data.Item)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Bar Chart of Loss Occurances by Type and Period", x = "Loss Type", y = "Count") + facet_wrap(~Period)
```
The following chart depicts loss occurrences by year. Since there are only 3 observed years, there is no pattern to see within this chart. However, 2016 has a significant increase in losses. Cross referencing surface level temperature changes reported by NOAA annually, we can see that second to 2024, 2016 has the highest change in temperature in the past 20 years (1.03 C, 33.8F). ***** ADD REF https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature *****

From our project created in the Fall 2023 semester, we found that varroa mites are the top cause for colony loss. Four states had the highest levels of varroa cases and were chosen for comparison, plus the United States: Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The box plot below shows one outlier in this top 5 areas, with the average being just above 50.
```{r}
ggplot(hcnydata_cleaned, aes(y = Varroa_Mites)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Varroa Mites",
       y = "Varroa Mites")
```
In comparison to the second most common cause of colony loss, the following scatterplot shows no correlation between disease and varroa mites.
```{r}
# Example scatter plot of two variables
ggplot(hcnydata_cleaned, aes(x = Varroa_Mites, y = Disease)) +

# Fit the model
glm_fit <- fit(glm_workflow, data = my_data)

# Print the model summary using tidy()
model_summary <- tidy(glm_fit)
print(model_summary)
```

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. I generally recommend the `here` package.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

*To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p\<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid.*

@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here.*

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```
