My name is Amelia Tristan. I am looking to use my graduate degree in pharmacy/healthcare. I have a BS in Math with a minor in Computer Science from StMU. I am obsessed with cats and Sanrio. I am also currently unemployed so if anyone knows if their employers are hiring, please let me know. The job market is rough ):

Here is a link to a scholarly article about cats and their outdoor roaming areas. Analysis shows male cats typically have a farther range of outdoor movement than female cats.
